        Bodyweight exercises are simple, effective ways to improve balance, flexibility, and strength without gym machines or equipment. You can do all these bodyweight exercises at home.</p>

          Lift yourself: What is a bodyweight workout?</p><p>
Bodyweight workouts are exercise routines that use a person’s own bodyweight to create resistance and improve strength, flexibility, and endurance, as well as coordination.<br><br>

You’ve probably done a push-up before — well done. You’ve already met bodyweight exercises. On occasion, you can use a wand or resistance band to support an exercise.<br><br>

While there are bodyweight exercises you can do in a gym (pull-ups, anyone?), having a calisthenics or plyometrics routine means you can stay in shape without the need for a gym membership or expensive equipment.

          Bodyweight vs. free weights
Pros:
You don’t need access to a gym.
While you still need to be careful, you can’t drop a weight on yourself if you’re not holding one.
