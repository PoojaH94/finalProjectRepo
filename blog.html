        <h1>10 Exercises for a Bodyweight Workout You Can Do Anywhere</h1>
    
    <div><a class="chartbeat-section" name="bodyweight-exercises-vs-other-workouts">Bodyweight exercises vs. other workouts</a></div>
    <p>We compared bodyweight exercises to other modes of working out. They compared pretty favorably.</p>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul><li>While beginners can start with full-body exercise, the reduced resistance of some gym machines may be a simpler entry point.</li><li>A gym’s pricing can be a barrier for some, but may still motivate others.</li><li>You might benefit from the trainers and staff that a gym provides, as well as the communal feel of an exercise class or group training session. But many group sessions are also available for bodyweight exercises (although they might be limited because of the pandemic).</li></ul>
    <h3>Bodyweight vs. cardio</h3>
    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul><li>Bodyweight exercises continue the burn after a workout, enhancing the metabolic advantages of the exercise. With cardio, like running, you’re only burning while you’re working out.</li><li>Bodyweight exercises give you cardio benefits while you’re working anyway, alongside the strength boost that comes from a hearty push- or pull-up.</li><li>An intense circuit of bodyweight exercises will get your heart going as much as any run.</li></ul>
    <h3>Keep the fuss to a minimum and stick with the basics.
</h3>
